# Swapnum_clang
This repository contains a C program for swapping two numbers. Swapping two numbers is a common programming task used to exchange the values of two variables, typically without using additional variables. This program provides a simple and efficient solution to perform this operation in the C programming language.
Key Features:

Swapping without a Temporary Variable: The program demonstrates how to swap two numbers without using an additional temporary variable. It employs bitwise XOR operations to achieve the swap.

User Input: The program allows the user to input two numbers, which will be swapped. It prompts the user to enter the values and then displays the swapped numbers as output.

Clear Comments: The code is well-documented with clear comments explaining each step of the swapping process, making it easy for programmers, including beginners, to understand the logic.

Modular Design: The code is modular, making it easy to reuse the swapping logic in other C programs.

Error Handling: The program includes error handling to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values. If non-numeric input is detected, the program provides an error message and prompts the user to input valid numbers.

Makefile: The repository includes a Makefile for easy compilation of the C program.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.

Use the provided Makefile to compile the C program using the make command.

Run the compiled program, and it will prompt you to enter two numbers.

After entering the numbers, the program will display the swapped values.

Example:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20

Numbers before swapping:
First number: 10
Second number: 20

Swapping numbers...

Numbers after swapping:
First number: 20
Second number: 10
This repository is a valuable resource for those learning C programming and looking to understand how to swap two numbers efficiently and effectively. It also serves as a handy reference for anyone needing to perform this operation in their C code.
